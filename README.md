# Color Splash
This was a class project made for SE 186 during our spring 2024 semester

It's a simple platformer game made with the Godot game engine. The object of the game is to get to the end of each level by using different paint buckets to change your character's color and allow him to pass through different obstacles.

Other contributors to the project were:
Mallory Flynn
Malak Mansour
Eleena Rath
Wyatt Sinclair
